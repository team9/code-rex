<p><strong><u>Code-Rex  Rules For Each Category</u></strong></p>
<br>
<ol>
  <li><em><strong><u>Knowledge-Based Round</u></strong></em></li>
<p>Think you  know HTML and web technology well enough? Give it a shot. We give you a  question... AND... we even offer you the answer. All you have to do is give a small  bit of it back to us. Simple enough right? Or is it?</p>
  <br>
  <li><em><strong><u>Algorithm-Based  Round</u></strong></em></li>
  <ol>
    <li><em>The  candidate is required to develop the code:</em></li>
    <ol>
      <li><em>The  code should read input from a given text file.</em></li>
      <li><em>The  code should be tested with input file provided for downloading.</em></li>
      <li><em>The  code should process the input and the output is to be written into another text  file in the specified format</em></li>
    </ol>
    <li><em>The  source code and output generated are to be uploaded.</em></li>
    <li><em>A  time limit is imposed on the attempt made. The above procedure of downloading  sample input, and uploading code and the generated output should be completed  within the count-down shown.</em></li>
    <li><em>The  contestant has a maximum of five attempts per question.</em></li>
  </ol>
  <br>
  <li><em><strong><u>Application  Development</u></strong></em></li>
<p> "App" the buzzword going around these days. Almost everyone capable of hearing must  be at least vaguely familiar with it... if not using them. This is your chance to  create one. We&rsquo;ll give you a step-by-step illustration of the situation to  depict. <br>
  Develop  the app bit-by-bit with the instructions and tips provided. Submit and await  what lies ahead. There is only one ultimate champion. The only question is... Will it be you? </p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li><em>A  theme is stated for which the candidates are required to develop the  application.</em></li>
    <li><em>Mark  distribution is based on specified features.</em></li>
    <li><em>Each  feature has a maximum mark. </em></li>
    <li><em>Marks  are distributed on various features of the application - look & feel,  functionalities, and perfection of individual function.</em></li>
    <li><em>A detailed Readme(should contain how to run the program?,Dependencies,Brief Explanation etc) file is required for each submission which has to be zipped along with source code.</em></li>
    <li><em>Participants can submit many solutions for this one</em></li>
    <li><em>Submissions will be evaluated only after the contest closes.</em></li>
